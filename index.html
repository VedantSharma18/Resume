        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Final year Computer Science and Engineering student. I like exploring new technologies and using them in 
           everyday life. I enjoy working on problems and developing solutions with increased efficiency. I am passionate 
           about Internet of things and have hands on experience in using Arduino UNO R3 board to develop working models. 
           I am a determined worker and a quick learner willing to take on challenging tasks and provide intended results.

                <h3>Facial Recognition Lock using Python and Arduino | August 2024</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>A smart facial recognition lock which opens a door when an authorized face is detected.</li>
                    <li>To train the face models using Python, Haar Cascade Algorithm was used.</li>
                    <li>After training of faces, a real time video feed from the webcam was used to detect the faces</li>
                    <li>If the face was detected and authorized, a serial signal was sent to the Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller which opened the lock.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Image Detection and Object Detection using YOLO V3 | May 2023</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>This was my small hobby project where I explored the domain of image detection and object detection using  python. </li>
                    <li> I worked on a program to detect objects using existing models.</li>
                    <li>The detection had an accuracy of 70-90% for video and images. The detection included everyday objects such as cars, humans etc. </li>
